# Sunflow Crypto Trading Bot for OKX
**Crypto Trading Bot to use on OKX, high frequency and efficient resource handling. Uses websockets to trade in realtime featuring trailing buy and sell. Option to use an additional klines interval to work as confirmation for buy orders, or via orderbook analysis or technical analysis simular to TradingView. Both prevent over-buying when price goes down. Can also behave as a dynamic gribot to save on funds where spread distance and profit percentage are customizable.**

This is the same bot, but now for OKX, please check out the original Sunflow Cryptobot (made for Bybit) to get more information. Sunflow is developed on Python version 12.7.
